    <h3>Dad's Breakfast Pizza</h3>
    <p>This recipe can be very versatile depending on your preferences. My whole family used to gather at 10 a.m. every Sunday morning at Mom and Dad's for breakfast. Dad made this up one Sunday, and it has been a favorite of ours ever since =) </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound baccon</li>
      <li>2 can refrigerated biscuits</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
      <li>12 eggs</li>
      <li>1 small onion</li>
      <li>1/2 green bell pepper</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a 9x12-inch baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
      <li>Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring often, until the bacon is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon pieces with a slotted spoon, and drain on paper towels.</li>
      <li>Open up the cans of biscuits, separate the biscuits, and arrange onto the prepared baking sheet so they touch. Press the biscuit dough down to seal them together into a crust that covers the baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is slightly cooked and very lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Do not overbake. Remove from oven.</li>
      <li>Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until the foam disappears. Beat the eggs in a bowl, and pour the eggs into the hot skillet. Use a spatula to lift and gently stir the eggs just until set, but still moist, 3 to 4 minutes. Arrange the lightly scrambled eggs on the semi-baked biscuit crust. Top with the cooked bacon, onion, and green pepper; spread the Cheddar cheese all over the pizza. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.</li>
      <li>Return to oven, and bake on the top rack until the cheese is melted and bubbling and has begun to brown, about 10 more minutes.</li>
